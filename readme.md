#TINY TRAINS TOY

* Build tracks to connect stations and take passengers.
* It's a bit like Mini Metro.
* The coloured dots against stations and trains shows you how many passengers there are and where they want to go.
* Passengers will automatically embark and alight if the train touches a station.
* At the moment there's no objective.

* Del to delete the last selected junction
* Right-click to deselect a junction.
