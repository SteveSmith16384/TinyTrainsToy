TINY TRAINS TOY

* Build tracks to connect stations and take passengers.
* It's a bit like Mini Metro.
* The coloured dots against stations and trains shows you how many passengers there are and where they want to go.
* At the moment there's no objective.



CONTROLS
Click mouse to build a new junction.  If you've got a junction currently selected, it will connect them with track, otherwise it will start a new track.
Right-click to deselect a junction.
Passengers will automatically embark and alight if the train touches a station.
