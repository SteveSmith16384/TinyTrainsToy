# TINY TRAINS

It's a bit like Mini Metro.

## OVERVIEW
* Build tracks to connect stations and take passengers.
* The coloured dots against stations and trains shows you how many passengers there are and where they want to go.
* Passengers will automatically embark and alight if the train touches a station.
* Buy a train buy clicking on the Buy Train icon.
* It's game over if you run out of money or there's more than 8 passengers waiting at a station.
* If two trains on different tracks are about to collide, they will both pause for a few seconds.
* Stations are randomly placed, and more stations are added over time.
* The mountains are obstacles and will block trains
* If the start and end points of a track are close enough together, trains will loop round
* Trains cost $1 per second to run
* Passengers give you money when they get to their destination


## CONTROLS
* Press J to build a new junction where the mouse is pointing.  If you've got a junction currently selected, it will connect them with track, otherwise it will start a new track.
* Drag junctions to move them and the connecting track
* I to insert a junction after the selected junction
* Right-click to deselect a junction.
* Del to delete the selected junction
* F1 to toggle Full-Screen


## FAQ
* The colour of the tracks is only to distinguish them, it has no bearing on the game.
