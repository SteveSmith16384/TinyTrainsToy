#TINY TRAINS TOY

* Build tracks to connect stations and take passengers.  It's a bit like Mini Metro.
* The coloured dots against stations and trains shows you how many passengers there are and where they want to go.
* Passengers will automatically embark and alight if the train touches a station.
* Buy a train buy clicking on the Buy Train icon.
* It's game over if you run out of money or there's more than 8 passengers waiting at a station.
* If two trains on different tracks collide, they will both pause for a few seconds.
* Stations are randomly placed, and more stations are added over time.


##CONTROLS
* Click mouse to build a new junction.  If you've got a junction currently selected, it will connect them with track, otherwise it will start a new track.
* Del to delete the last selected junction
* Right-click to deselect a junction.
